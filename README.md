# Capstone Project: Sparkify


### Medium Blog Post
Here is the Medium blog post I have written regarding the project:https://medium.com/@emrebilgehangedik/sparkify-project-bb136e94b678


### Project Motivation
The project focuses on churn problem of companies. Churn happens when a customer cancels his/her membership, or sometimes downgrades his/her services. Churn basically decreases a company's number of subscribed users so has a negative effect in terms of profit. Companies try to detect the customers who have a potential to churn and give additional offers to these customers. This is why it is important to have a precise model for detecting churn. In the project I define churn, extract features from the dataset and train some alternative classification models.

In the data exploration process I also try to answer the following questions:
“Who are the most popular artists and what are the most popular songs in the dataset?”
"In which hours in a day, the most number of songs are listened to?"


### Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
1. pyspark.sql
2. seaborn
3. matplotlib.pyplot
4. datetime


### File Descriptions
1. sparkify.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code that loads the dataset, cleans the data, make explatory analysis. The notebook also contains feature extraction process and training different models with classification algorithms.
